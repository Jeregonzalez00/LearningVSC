# 🚀 Practicing with Visual Studio Code & GitHub 💻

Hey there! 👋  
This is a small practice project where I’m learning to use **VS Code** together with **GitHub**.  
The goal is to improve my skills in:

- 🧑‍💻 Java programming ☕  
- 🔄 Basic Git and GitHub workflow  
- 🧠 Good development habits  
- 📝 Writing and editing `README.md` files

---

## 📂 Repository Content

- `PracticaGitHub.java` → My very first Java program in this setup ✨  
- Configuration and test files 🧪

---

## 🛠️ What I’m Practicing

- 📌 Cloning and pushing repositories  
- 💬 Writing clear commit messages  
- 🪄 Syncing changes directly from VS Code  
- 🤝 Using branches and pull requests (coming soon)

---

## 🐣 Goal

This isn’t a serious project — I’m just **breaking things a little to learn** 😅  
But the idea is to keep improving step by step.
